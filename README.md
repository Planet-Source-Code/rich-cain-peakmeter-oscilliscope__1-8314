## Peakmeter/oscilliscope


</div>

### Description

This code reads a chunk of data in from the microphone into an array. It displays a volume-meter that doesn't depend on the 'peakmeter' function of the mixer (so it works on a soundblaster-live). It also displays an ossiliscope window.
 
### More Info
 
Most of this code was taken from the API-Guide from www.allapi.net, but I had to change bits so it works on a soundblaster live. There are probably things that need tidying up still!
